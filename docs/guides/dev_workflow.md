basic steps (add detail):

- create branch for feature/fix
- pull latest updates from main branch to avoid conflicts
- make changes (update docs as needed)
- commit
- push
- pull request
- some team member reviews pr and gives feedback if they have any
    - example feedback: add comments for clarity, include corresponding documentation, improve variable naming, this part could be simplified
    - this process can keep team members informed,  encourage better code quality and help us learn from each other's work
- merge branch into main
- delete branch
